class-website-template
======================

This is the source code for the SSU CS210 Website.

I intend to make this more generic so it can be used by any class by making changes to a config file.

As of now to make changes `labs.json` and `lectures.json` will need to be adjusted as well as the files in the content folder. Some of the html has values hard coded into it which I wish to remove in the future. An offline compile process would ideally convert yaml config files into json and create the entire site.
